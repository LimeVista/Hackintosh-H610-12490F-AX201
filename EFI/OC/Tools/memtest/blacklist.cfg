# MemTest86 baseboard blacklist file
# 
# This file contains a list of baseboards and corresponding UEFI BIOS firmware that are known to have issues that prevent MemTest86 from booting properly. 
# Adding a baseboard to the list shall restrict some functionality, but doing so may allow MemTest86 to boot properly.
#
# Blacklist format:
# 
# Each blacklisted baseboard is stored on a separate line with the following format:
#
# <baseboard>,<BIOS version>,<EXACT|PARTIAL>,<restriction flag>
#
#    <baseboard> is the case-sensitive baseboard string in double quotes (eg. "X99-DELUXE")
#
#    <BIOS version> is the first BIOS version (string in double quotes) that no longer exhibits the issue. If no fix is available, specify ALL.
#
#    <EXACT|PARTIAL> determines whether exact or partial matching is used on <baseboard string>.
#
#    <restriction flag> determines the restriction policy to impose if there is a match. This can be one of the following values:
#
#      RESTRICT_STARTUP : Display a warning message before MemTest86 boots
#      RESTRICT_MP      : Do not perform the multiprocessor test during startup, and set the default CPU mode to SINGLE
#      DISABLE_MP       : Completely disable multiprocessor support, restricting the CPU mode to SINGLE only
#      DISABLE_CONCTRL  : Disable console control protocol, which may be needed for some older systems (eg. iMac 7.1)
#      FIXED_SCREENRES  : Do not modify the default screen resolution, which is known to cause issues on some Lenovo systems
#      RESTRICT_ADDR    : Set the lower address limit to 0x100000 by default, which may be needed for some Mac systems (eg. Late 2013 27" iMac)
#      TEST12_SINGLECPU : Run Test 12 in SINGLE CPU Mode. Workaround for CPU threads hanging in PARALLEL mode.
#      DISABLE_LANG     : Disable language support and font installation, which is known to cause issues on some Dell systems
